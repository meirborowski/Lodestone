# Third-Party Licenses

Lodestone uses the third-party software listed below. Every dependency is permissively licensed. Exported games
include this file, because licenses such as MIT require their notices to ship with binary distributions.

When adding a dependency, add it here with its full license text (see [Tech Stack & Build](docs/TechStack.md#libraries)).
