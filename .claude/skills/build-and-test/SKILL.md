# Build and Test Lodestone

Every change gets built and tested (see `docs/Testing.md`). Run the steps below from the repository root.

## 1. Environment
- **Windows**: the commands must run in a Visual Studio 2026 developer environment, or Ninja can't find MSVC. In a plain PowerShell, enter it first:
  ```powershell
  $vs = & "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe" -latest -property installationPath
  & "$vs\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1" -Arch amd64 -HostArch amd64 -SkipAutomaticLocation
  $env:CC = 'cl'; $env:CXX = 'cl'
  ```
  Each new shell needs this again.
- **Ubuntu**: export `CC=gcc-14 CXX=g++-14` (or `CC=clang-19 CXX=clang++-19`) before the first configure of a build tree. GLFW needs the window system development files, and the engine the Vulkan loader: `sudo apt install pkg-config libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libvulkan1`.
- **macOS**: the Vulkan SDK (version in `docs/TechStack.md#build-prerequisites`) provides DXC, MoltenVK and the Vulkan loader. Install it, then run `sudo ./install_vulkan.py` in its directory.
- **lavapipe**, for the rendering tests: on Windows, CMake downloads it. On Linux, build it once with `tools/build-lavapipe.sh` (its header lists the packages it needs), then reconfigure. Without it, reference-image tests are skipped with a message; macOS always skips them.
- **Code style tools**: `pip install -r tools/requirements.txt`, ideally in a virtual environment (`.venv` in the repository root is ignored by Git). Put its scripts directory on the `PATH`.

## 2. Build and test
```sh
cmake --workflow --preset debug
```
This configures `build/debug`, builds it, and runs every test. The other presets are `release`, `dist` and, with GCC or Clang, `asan`. For a quicker loop: `cmake --build --preset debug` then `ctest --preset debug -L unit`.

Failed tests print their output. To run one doctest case directly: `build/debug/Tests/LodestoneCoreTests --test-case="<name>"`. A failed reference-image test writes the rendered image and a difference image to `build/<preset>/RenderOutput` - look at them. If the change is meant to alter rendering, follow the `update-reference-images` skill.

## 3. Style
```sh
python tools/format.py --fix
python tools/tidy.py --build-dir build/debug
```
clang-tidy treats every finding as an error. Fix the code rather than suppressing a check; if a check is wrong for this codebase, turn it off in `.clang-tidy` with the reason in the list at the top of that file. clang-tidy needs the generated shader headers, so build the tree (or at least `cmake --build --preset debug --target LodestoneClientShaders`) before running it.

## 4. Before a pull request
Run the `debug`, `release` and `dist` workflows (every test tier), the format check and clang-tidy. All must pass. Never skip, weaken or delete a test to get there (see Test Integrity in `docs/Testing.md`).
